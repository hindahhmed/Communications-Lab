# ALAIN WATER 

AlAin water is a website consisting information revolving around the bottled water brand, AlAin. The original video created was an advertisment, and because of that, I have decided to center my website around the bottled water company. 

# PLANNING #

While I had created a wireframe for website, it did not involve any interactive elements. I had decided not to follow my wireframe layout and create something interactive instead. I wanted to add a section in which the user is able to control which tabs they can access, and the website leadinf to different tabs when it is clicked.
