# ALAIN WATER 

AlAin water is a website consisting information revolving around the bottled water brand, AlAin. The original video created was an advertisment, and because of that, I have decided to center my website around the bottled water company. My goal was to create a website centered around AlAin water, and discuss the importance of sustainability. 

# PLANNING #

While I had created a wireframe for website, it did not involve any interactive elements. I had decided not to follow my wireframe layout and create something interactive instead. I wanted to add a section in which the user is able to control which tabs they can access, and the website leading to different tabs when it is clicked. I wanted to split my website into 3 different sections: the home page, about us, and the page displaying the video. Alongside some additional information as well.

# EXECUTION #  

The website begins with a Home Page, with a green and blue background. For the homepage, I wanted to keep it very simple and easy to navigate. When the user scrolls down, a contact us area is availible, with links to different social media platforms. I implemented this in order to add a level of interaction, as well as allowing the user to be able to visit AlAin's social media platforms. When the user clicks of the bar at the top right corner of the screen, they are guided to a tab which allows them to decide which page they would like to be on. If the user clicks on 'About Us', they are redirected to a page discussing the importance of sustainability, as our video centered arount the idea of sustainability. Moreover, if the user clicks on 'Video', they are redirected to a page featuring the video created, and when the user scrolls down, there is a text discussing the team behind the video, and the company.

## Difficulties ##

There were several difficulties I was faced with while creating the website. Initially, I wanted to add pictures, which fade and uncover a text under when the tracker is placed on top, however, when attempting to code this, it would not work. i decided against adding the pictures, and kept the website very simple and easy to navigate. 

Another difficulty I was faced with was adding links to the social media icons at the bottom of the home page. When I initially coded this, it did not correspond to the appropriate icon, however, when I found the mistake, I was able to fix it, and the website ran smoothly.
